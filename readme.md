## **Yaadein virtual memories**

*A virtual meet to your loved once.*

An application which uses AI to interact Human with another virtual human. Simple we give audio/questions/text as input and output the relavent video and audio. We can say it a virtual meeting with a person who has passed away and you still want to keep them alive in video memories. So A real person can sit in fron of computer and can interact/talk with the other person in the software which no more exist but have their vide memories. A person could alsk question like "What is your name?" and the other person in the software will reply accordingly. A short pre recorded video clip will play in response.



#### Why? Concept?

When we convey any information to third person there is always a loss of information.



#### Prerequisites

We can prepare a questionnaire of basic questions such as "What is your name?", "How are you?", "Where do you belong from"



Once we have the questions we have to record short clips of the person (here we are talking about old age person or a younger one) whome we want in our software. One by one asking them questions and recording all the answers they gave.



mapping all this video clips to particular questions and we are ready to test



now on hering that question software will play particular video clip of the person.
